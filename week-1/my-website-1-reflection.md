Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp 
U1.W1: [My] Website Reflection

##Prompt:

Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository. 
Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person. 
Describe what open source means. 
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia? 
Assess the importance of using licenses. 
What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with? 
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository on Github, go to the '+' button next to your profile pic in the upper right corner and click New Repository. Then, fill in the name; check public or private; select a license; and check the 'include README' box. Push Create. Done.

To clone a repository, find the repository URL on its Github page (lower half right hand column), go to your command line and type 'git clone {URL}.'

Open source means that it is generally free and available to use, with some restrictions based on the license (such as necessity to give credit, ability to monetize, etc.) Personally, I very much support open source software. Allowing netizens the ability to easily access and tinker with such powerful software gives people the ability to create new and amazing things for free (or with limited cost). Share information so we can keep building! For example, I just learned about this incredible project. Because the creator of this software offers it open source, people who suffer from ALS/MND can now get eye-tracking software for free. Absolutely awesome!

I think the use of licenses is important for keeping the open source movement fair. If someone works extremely hard to build something, credit should be given where it is due. Likewise, if someone does a lot of work to harness the power of open source software and chooses to monetize that process, they should be able to do so with a particular type of license. I think the key issue is one of control: open source licenses give control to the producer of that software. He (or she) can decide how freely they wish to distribute their product. Ultimately, allowing some control keeps people motivated to continue supporting the open source movement.

Since I have many friends who work in the tech industry, and I've done some web development on open source platforms like Wordpress, the material for this challenge was not new to me. However, I really appreciate that DBC makes such great use of open source resources. I think SourceForge is a great place to explore open source software; just be careful what you download!
