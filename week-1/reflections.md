Reflections

1.1 Think About Time

Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp 
U1.W1: Thinking About Time Reflection

Prompt:

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about? 
What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0? 
How do you manage your time currently? 
Is your current strategy working? If not, why not? 
Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how? 
What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

Reflection:

After going through all the provided links, I was most intrigued by the techniques of meditation and the 'tiny habit.' Both are techniques that I have used effectively in the past. Meditation - taking a few minutes every day to focus and clear the mind - is good for de-stressing and encouraging creative receptivity. Using immediate rewards and breaking down larger tasks into small, achievable ones helps to turn tiny habits into larger, sustainable forms of self-discipline. As I am a very habit-oriented person, it is necessary for me to take conscious control of the development of good habits. In addition, I find meditation key for reducing stress and building capacity to focus.

Also, in my opinion, the 'time boxing' technique is one of the most useful and basic building blocks for good time management. Setting aside terminable chunks of time for specific activities is a good way to relieve stress over difficult tasks (you don't have to finish it; you just need to work on it) and for assessing the difficulty of a project (based on the measurable amount of time spent).

Generally, I manage my time by creating a weekly schedule on a spreadsheet in Google Drive. Goals are listed for the week, and then loosely mapped to the days. Then, each evening I review the goals for the following day and create a daily plan of attack, working in other items like chores and exercise.

For the most part, my strategy is effective, although I have to restrain myself from being overly ambitious about my weekly goals. Marking some goals as 'optional' has been helpful for me. Also, I've noticed that a more thorough breakdown is sometimes required for larger goals - for example, 'code this project' needs to be broken down into smaller steps.

In terms of techniques I will attempt to use to increase productivity, I think daily meditation would be really helpful. Meditation is already part of my yoga practice, but I think a smaller independent habit would also be very beneficial, since throwing down a mat is not always time efficient. Also, as mentioned above, starting small and breaking down projects into more manageable, less intimidating chunks is really important for me to stay motivated.

To stay focused during Phase 0, I intend to maintain my habit of weekly schedules as well as daily plans. Using time blocks has always been very effective for me, so I will continue to use that technique. I also want to work in a short morning meditation.

1.2 The Command Line

Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp 
U1.W1: Command Line Reflection

Prompt:

What is a shell? What is "bash?" 
What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? 
Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? 
In your opinion, what are the most important arguments to know? 
Can you remember what each of the [commands below] does off the top of your head? Write what each does.

Reflection:

A shell is a user-interface for a computer's operating system. Bash is a common text-based shell. Although I have some familiarity with using the command line, to be truly effective, it has to become second nature, which means practice. I'm glad that we are beginning Dev Bootcamp with this challenge. It is extremely important.

For me, the most challenging part of learning this material is memorizing all the different command arguments. Although the most basic commands are few and fairly simple, there are so many options that can be used to increase efficiency. It's a little intimidating. I think the most essential arguments are those for setting/changing permissions, passing along input and output, and basic navigation.

-pwd: Print working directory

-ls: List the contents of the current directory

-grep: Search in a file

-mv: Rename a file

-cd: Change directory

-../: Go up a level

-touch: Create a new file

-mkdir: Create a new directory

-echo: Print out arguments

-less: Print out the contents of a file

-rmdir: Remove a directory

-cat: Stream all the contents of a file

-rm: Remove a file

-help: Man for Windows (man is manual or the argument documentation for Mac OS)

-exit: Exit the shell

It also occurs to me that one of the biggest challenges in learning to program, which arises very early on when trying to use the command line, is understanding where you are theoretically - without much visual cue. Essentially, you have to track your data, and your own 'presence' through the computer without the visual aids that the GUI gives you. It requires a certain level of abstraction that can be difficult.

I, for one, need to check -pwd and -ls often because it helps me create a mental image of where I am. Similarly, when writing programs, I need to use GDP or another debugger and check my breakpoints frequently to understand how my input is changing through the program. I think being familiar with, and comfortable, with this abstraction is key to becoming a good programmer.

1.3 Forking and Cloning

Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp 
U1.W1: Create, Fork and Clone Repositories Reflection

Prompt:

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one? 
What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

Reflection:

A repository is essentially a directory or folder, just like on your own computer. It can contain files and other folders, and can be either public or private. If you wish to work on a repository, and you have the permissions to do so, it is advisable to create a separate copy of the repository to tinker with.

This copy is called a fork and will be added to your remote Github profile. You create a fork so that you can modify or play with the repository without the risk of damaging working code. A fork can be set to pull any changes to the original into itself, so that it remains constantly updated; in this way, it is a better option than just creating a whole new repository. Also, once you are done working on the fork, and the changes have been thoroughly tested and approved by the owner of the repository, they can then be merged back into the master.

A clone is a local copy (kept on your computer) of a repository. It can be worked on without internet access to the remote repository, and it also allows multiple people to work on a single repository at once.

To create a fork, simply go the desired repository and push the fork button in the upper right hand corner, then assign the new fork to yourself. To clone that fork to your computer, go to your CLI and type 'git clone {URL - to be found in the right hand column of the fork page}.' Git will then download a clone of the repository into your local working directory - where ever you happened to be when you typed the above.

Setting up git and Github is very easy once you are comfortable working in the command line. Github, in particular, is incredibly intuitive and its GUI makes it easier for beginners. Learning the git commands, on the other hand, can be a bit difficult. Practice makes perfect!
