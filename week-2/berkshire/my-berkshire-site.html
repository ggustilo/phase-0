- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I have made a few simple website before, so I'm pretty familiar with how HTML works, and CSS as well, but it's nice to see something so complete.  It was quite satisfying actually.

Researching and using semantic HTML is pretty intuitive for me - it's about the logical expression of meaning in addition to the visual representation.  Actually, thinking about it that way helps me to organize my thoughts and content better.  It's awesome!

I think I was pretty good about separating the content from the formatting.  Having a little bit of experience with CSS actually helps, because you can kind of see how the formatting is going to be laid on top.  Also, I've seen sights that mix up formatting between the HTML and CSS, and that is INCREDIBLY annoying.  Thus, I try my best to keep them separate.

In general, HTML is pretty tedious to work through.  Yes, going through the process can help you organize the content logically, but tagging everything is pretty boring.  On the other hand, when you consider what you're actually doing - rendering plain text into a browser - its pretty cool.

No tricks for me; just practice.  And Google. :)
