#Site Map Reflection

Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp
U1.W2 Site Map

##Prompt:

What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

##Reflection:

The six phases of web design are:

1. Research & Gathering Information
2. Planning
3. Designing
4. Developing
5. Testing
6. Maintenance

My site's primary goal is to introduce me as a web designer and developer.  My site will be pretty simple - a little bit of information about me, a picture, some portfolio examples, and contact information (email, social media links, maybe a contact form).

I see my target audience as potential clients and employers, who want to know more about me, and see my design sensibilities/development capabilities in action.

The primary action I want my users to take is to contact me.  My website should be their last stop in their research about me.  They will probably hear about me first from something else - my resume, my LinkedIn, a friend, maybe my blog.  They will go to my website for a demonstration of my professional capabilities.  I want the site to give an immediate good impression - a 'wow, this chick really knows how to make a nice website; I should contact her...'  Looking at the about page or my portfolio would just be an extra verification step before they contact me.  Hence, all my contact information will be front and center.

Designing a website or application is about solving a problem.  What are the goals of the site? How do we achieve those goals? What content needs to be emphasized, and how do we do that?  Design is not a purely creative process, in which you produce something that just looks good.  Each design decision should have a rationale based on the site's goals and the desired user experience.  

User experience plays into the site design as a whole because it takes into account the needs of the site or application's users.  What are they trying to do? What content are they looking for? How easy is it to accomplish what they are trying to do?  How can we streamline their experience, and make it more enjoyable and efficient?  User experience design is valuable because the goal of most websites or applications is to communicate something to, or elicit a response from, the user.  The goal of user experience design is to figure out how best to accomplish those tasks, so that the user leaves satisfied and the desired goal is achieved.

Coming from a marketing and web design background, none of the material for this challenge was new for me.  However, I wouldn't say that I found it tedious per se.  All of the articles were well-written and it's always helpful to reiterate the rationale for why we do things a certain way.  It helps to focus in on what we are really trying to accomplish when we make certain decisions or ask certain questions.

Perhaps making the site map was a bit tedious, simply because mine is so simple it was almost unnecessary. Well, that, and I just finished a personal website on SquareSpace a couple months ago, and this was a total repeat of the process I went through then.
