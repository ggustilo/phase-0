<!-- 
How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?) 
-->
			<p>Chrome's DevTools allow you to update things in the browser to experiment with formatting and position, or to troubleshoot problems.</p>

			<p>You can resize elements on the DOM using the CSS properties of width and height in either the stylesheet or in the DevTools.</p>

			<p>Absolute, fixed, static, and relative are all options for the display property.  Static is the default display, and means that elements fall within the normal flow of the page - if given no other positioning, then on top of each other.  Relative means that the element will be positioned relative to its normal, static position.  Absolute means that the element will be positioned relative to the most immediate parent element that also has a position.  Fixed means that the element will be positied relative to the viewport - the browser window.  I find absolute to be the most intuitive property to use.  I think relative is a bit hazy, because it's sometimes difficult to know what the otherwise 'normal' posiiton would be.</p>

			<p>Margin is the distance around the object, outside its border; border frames the object all the way around; and padding is the distance between the border and the content inside the object.</p>

			<p>Overall, I found this challenge to be helpful in realizing my weak points in understanding positioning.  I learned a lot with this challenge, even though most of the releases were pretty easy.</p>
