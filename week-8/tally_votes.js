// __________________________________________
// Reflection

// What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
// Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
// What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?

// I learned that iterating over nested objects in JavaScript is a pain.  Database all the way.

// We didn't really find any useful methods, to be honest.  Instead, we ended up writing our own.  That - to me - is the main difference between JavaScript and Ruby.  In Ruby, there are tons of methods that are easy to use and output data pretty much in the form you would need.  Not in JavaScript - in JS there are few methods, and they are difficult to use.  For example, we tried to use keys for one section of our solution, but couldn't get it working, and ended up abandoning it.  However, in JS it is really easy to write your own functions and call on any available object, which is very free-ing in a way.

// I think I really appreciate DRY code, after this challenge.  Usually, I like to try and work straight towards the clean solution, but in this challenge it was just too many levels of iteration to think through at once, so we had to do our initial solution and then refactor to make it DRY...and look how many lines of code we saved!
